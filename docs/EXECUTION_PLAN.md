Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding. Let me provide a comprehensive answer:

  Where is the MCP Server Hosted & How Does the Model Access It?

  The FastMCP Server Runs INSIDE the Lambda Function

  You're absolutely correct in your analysis! Here's exactly how it works:

  1. MCP Server Hosting Location

  # In BedrockMCPAgent.__init__()
  def __init__(self):
      # Initialize MCP server WITH SECURITY CONTEXT inside Lambda
      self.mcp_server = GPTTherapyMCPServer()  # ← FastMCP server created in Lambda
      self._session_context: SessionSecurityContext | None = None

  The FastMCP server is instantiated and runs entirely within the AWS Lambda function. It's not a separate service or network endpoint.

  2. Model Access Pattern

  You're spot on - Bedrock models don't directly call MCP servers. Here's the actual flow:

  graph TB
      subgraph "AWS Lambda Function"
          A[Email Trigger] --> B[Parse Session ID]
          B --> C[Create MCP Server Instance]
          C --> D[Set Authenticated Context]
          D --> E[Call Bedrock with Tool Definitions]

          subgraph "Tool Execution Loop"
              F[Bedrock Returns Tool Calls] --> G[Lambda Executes MCP Tools]
              G --> H[MCP Server Processes Securely]
              H --> I[Return Results to Bedrock]
              I --> J[Bedrock Continues Generation]
          end

          E --> F
          J --> K[Final Response]
      end

      L[Bedrock API] -.->|API Call| E
      L -.->|Tool Schema| E
      G -.->|Execute Tool| L

  3. Bedrock Tool Calling Support

  Bedrock Claude 3.5+ does support function calling, but not direct MCP protocol. Here's how we bridge this:

  # Lambda sends tool definitions to Bedrock
  body = {
      "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
      "max_tokens": self.max_tokens,
      "tools": [  # ← Bedrock native tool format
          {
              "name": "add_player",
              "description": "Add player to session",
              "parameters": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {"player_email": {"type": "string"}}
              }
          }
      ],
      "messages": messages
  }

  # Bedrock responds with tool_use requests
  response = {
      "content": [
          {"type": "text", "text": "I'll add that player"},
          {
              "type": "tool_use",
              "id": "tool_123",
              "name": "add_player",
              "input": {"player_email": "user@example.com"}
          }
      ]
  }

  4. The Lambda Tool Execution Bridge

  # Lambda intercepts Bedrock tool calls and routes to MCP
  async def _process_bedrock_response(self, response_body, messages, tools):
      for tool_call in tool_calls:
          tool_name = tool_call.get("name")      # "add_player"
          tool_input = tool_call.get("input")    # {"player_email": "..."}

          # Execute via in-process MCP server (NOT network call)
          result = await self._execute_mcp_tool(tool_name, tool_input)

          # Add result back to conversation with Bedrock
          tool_results.append({
              "type": "tool_result",
              "tool_use_id": tool_call.get("id"),
              "content": json.dumps(result)
          })

  Why This Architecture Works

  1. No Network Latency

  - MCP server runs in the same process as the Lambda
  - Tool execution is in-memory function calls
  - No external HTTP requests or network overhead

  2. Security Isolation

  - Session context is set once at Lambda startup
  - MCP server has access to authenticated session
  - Bedrock never sees session IDs or internal state

  3. Protocol Translation

  - Bedrock Input: Native Claude tool calling format
  - Internal Processing: FastMCP framework handles tool routing
  - Security Layer: Session ID injection and response sanitization

  FastMCP as an In-Process Library

  FastMCP in our implementation is not a standalone server but rather a library framework that:

  1. Provides tool registration: @mcp.tool decorator pattern
  2. Handles tool routing: Maps tool names to Python functions
  3. Manages tool schemas: Auto-generates tool definitions for Bedrock
  4. Processes tool calls: Executes tools with authenticated context

  # FastMCP is used as a library, not a network service
  class GPTTherapyMCPServer:
      def __init__(self):
          self.mcp = FastMCP("GPTTherapy Session Manager")  # ← Library instance

      @self.mcp.tool  # ← Decorator registers tool
      async def add_player(player_email: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
          # Tool implementation runs in Lambda process

  Complete Flow Summary

  1. Email arrives → Lambda triggered
  2. Session authenticated → MCP server created with context
  3. Bedrock called → With tool definitions (no session info)
  4. Model requests tools → Lambda intercepts and routes to MCP
  5. MCP executes securely → With pre-authenticated session context
  6. Results returned → Sanitized responses back to Bedrock
  7. Final response → Generated with tool assistance

  This architecture gives us the power of MCP tool organization with Bedrock's native function calling while maintaining enterprise-grade security -
  all within a single Lambda execution context!
